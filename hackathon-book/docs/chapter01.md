# Chapter 01 — Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming how teams design, build, document, and maintain software.  
Traditional documentation requires continuous manual updates, but AI-driven systems now automate large parts of this process.

In this chapter, we explore:

- What AI-driven documentation means  
- Why modern teams prefer spec-driven workflows  
- The importance of consistent, structured documentation  
- How RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enhances accuracy  
- Real-world examples of AI automating technical content  

This chapter sets the foundation for understanding the rest of the book.
