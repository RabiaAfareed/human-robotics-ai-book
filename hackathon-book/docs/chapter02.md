# Chapter 02 — Specification-Driven Development

Specification-driven development (SDD) ensures that software is built according to a single source of truth: a **specification file**.

## Key Principles

- All requirements are written clearly before development begins.  
- AI and tools can generate documentation, tests, and code from the same spec.  
- Updates to the spec automatically update the system.

## Benefits

- Consistency  
- Reduced human errors  
- Faster onboarding  
- Predictable development cycles  

This approach becomes powerful when combined with AI agents.
