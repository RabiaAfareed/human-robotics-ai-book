# Chapter 07 — RAG Chatbots

Documentation is no longer limited to static pages.  
Teams now rely on **AI chatbots** that can answer questions using internal documents.

### Features of RAG Bots

- Contextual answers  
- Fact-checked responses  
- Multi-step reasoning  
- Live document retrieval  

We explore tools like vector databases, embeddings, and indexing strategies.
